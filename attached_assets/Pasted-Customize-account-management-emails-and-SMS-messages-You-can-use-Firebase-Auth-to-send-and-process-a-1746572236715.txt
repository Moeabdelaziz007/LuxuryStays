Customize account management emails and SMS messages
You can use Firebase Auth to send and process account management emails and SMS messages. These messages allow your users to complete the following account management tasks:

Resetting a forgotten password
Reverting an email address change (for example, if an email address change was unsolicited)
Verifying the user's email address
To learn how to send account management messages, see the developer documentation for iOS, Android, and web sites.

For each email type, you can customize the email's sender name, sender address, reply-to address, subject line, and—for password reset emails—the message.

Customize email fields
When you customize an email template's subject line and message, you can use the following placeholder strings to represent values that will be filled in before sending:

%DISPLAY_NAME%	The recipient's display name
%APP_NAME%	The name of your app. You can set this value by editing the Public-facing name field on the Settings page
%LINK%	The URL that the recipient must visit to complete the account management task. See Customize the action link URL
%EMAIL%	The recipient's email address
%NEW_EMAIL%	The new email address to set as the recipient's primary address. Used only in the Email Address Change template
Customize the action link URL
To use your own server to handle account management emails, specify the URL to your server's account management page:

Click an email type.
Click the pencil icon to begin editing the email template.
Click customize action URL.
Specify the URL to your server's account management page. Two parameters, mode and oobCode, will be appended to the URL when emails are sent. For example: https://example.com/acctmgmt/__/auth/action?mode=<action>&oobCode=<code>.
Customize the sender domain
To specify a sender address with a custom domain:

Click an email type.
Click the pencil icon to begin editing the email template.
Click customize domain.
Specify the domain you want to use and follow the provided instructions to verify that you own the domain.
